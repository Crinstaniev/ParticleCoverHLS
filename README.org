* ParticleCoverHLS

This project is a HLS implementation of the ParticleCover algorithm from [[https://github.com/mbahng/ParticleCover/][ParticleCover]]

** Coding Convention

=class= converted to =struct= to accomondate HLS.
Each struct has its own header and source code file.

TODO: Add more details

** Known Problems

- Initialization of =cover= failed. I guess it is due to the size of the struct.

Data Hierarchy:
+ cover
  + dataset
    + env
    + point[NUM_LAYERS][MAX_NUM_POINTS]
  + env
  + patch[MAX_NUM_PATCHES]
    + superpoints[NUM_LAYERS]
      + points[MAX_NUM_POINTS]
  + patch[MAX_NUM_PATCHES]
    + superpoints[NUM_LAYERS] 
      + points[MAX_NUM_POINTS]
  + superpoint[NUM_LAYERS]
    + points[MAX_NUM_POINTS]

NUM_LAYERS = 5
MAX_NUM_POINTS = 1024
MAX_NUM_PATCHES = 32
